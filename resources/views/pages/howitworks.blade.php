    <h1> How It Works </h1>
    <p> 1.	Users can search for dogs available for adoption on the website by using various filters such as breed, age, and location. They can also browse through all the dogs that are currently available.
        2.	Once they find a dog they're interested in, they can create an account by clicking on the "Sign up" button. This will require them to provide some basic information such as their name, email address, and a password.
        3.	To verify their account, users will typically receive an email containing a link that they need to click. Once their account is verified, they can log in and start using the website.
        4.	Users can create a profile that includes information about themselves, their lifestyle, and what kind of dog they're looking for. This can help match them with a dog that is a good fit for their home.
        5.	After that, user can then post all the dogs for adoption with all the information and feature of the dog. They can also search for dogs they want to adopt by filter criteria.
        6.	Once a user finds a dog they want to adopt, they can submit an adoption application. This will typically include information such as their address, contact information, and information about their home and lifestyle.
        7.	The organization or individual responsible for the dog will review the application and make a decision about whether to approve the adoption. If the adoption is approved, the dog will go to the new home, and the new owner will be responsible for providing a loving, safe and healthy environment for the dog.
        8.	Post Adoption, new owner and organization or individual responsible for the dog, stay in touch and provide updates of the dog.
        
        It's important to note that different organizations have different policies and procedures for dog adoptions, so the specific process may vary from website to website.
